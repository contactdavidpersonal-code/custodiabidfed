/**
 * Per-practice grounding spec for the hybrid chat+evidence flow.
 *
 * Source: CMMC Self-Assessment Guide — Level 1, v2.0 (Dec 2021).
 * Each entry embeds the official practice statement + every NIST SP 800-171A
 * assessment objective letter. Charlie uses this verbatim — never paraphrases —
 * so users get assessor-grade accuracy.
 *
 * To add a new practice, follow the AC.L1-3.1.1 shape: copy the official
 * statement, list every objective, list the evidence slot kinds an assessor
 * would actually accept under the SAG's "Examine / Interview / Test" methods.
